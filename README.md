# stack
### From [SeveraTheDuck](https://github.com/SeveraTheDuck)
*Criticism is welcome.*

This program includes my version of stack data structure. The work on it is still in progress. <br>
The goals are:<br>
<ol>
    <li> Better doxygen.
    <li> Different types of stack supported at once.
</ol>

What is done:<br>
<ol>
    <li>Convenient config file - you can enable and disable canary and hash protection, debug mode and switch types of stack data. </li>
    <li>Log file is also should be declared in config file, so you could see your mistakes while working.</li>
    <li>Standart pop and push functions.</li>
</ol>
For more information read [docs](severatheduck.github.io/stack/) for each function!
