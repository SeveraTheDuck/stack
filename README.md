# stack
### From [SeveraTheDuck](https://github.com/SeveraTheDuck)
*Criticism is welcome.*

This program includes my version of stack data structure. The work on it is still in progress. <br>
The goals are:<br>
<ol>
<li> Better doxygen.
<li> Different types of stack supported at once.
</ol>

What is done:
1. Convenient config file - you can enable and disable canary and hash protection, debug mode and switch types of stack data.
2. Log file is also should be declared in config file, so you could see your mistakes while working.
3. Standart pop and push functions.

For more information read docs for each function!
